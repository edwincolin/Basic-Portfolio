            <h2>About Me</h2>
           
            
            <p>
                Hello and Welcome to My Coding Portfolio! I've worked in a warehouse enviorment for over
            7 years and currently a supervisor with my currrent employer. I have been getting into specifications 
            of coding for a couple of months now, extremely excited to learn as much as I can.</p>

            <p>
                I was born in Los Angeles, California then moved to Salt Lake City at a young age. Graduated from
            West High School in 2012 where I played on the soccer and football team until an injury in my
            Junior year derailed me going forward. Thats when I learned to enjoy reading and studying any subject 
            in my spare time. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Coding helps me put my brain to the test which is something I enjoy. The job I would love is to work 
            for a company that is a team and helps eachother grow in a variety of ways. I'm ready to step into this 
            new world of technology!
            </p>
